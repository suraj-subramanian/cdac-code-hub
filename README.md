# cdac-code-hub
Code Repository for CDAC PGDAC.
This repository is a work in progress which will contain all the common programming problems and code which will help PGDAC students during their course.



### Problems
1. Find the greatest of three numbers. [See code](https://github.com/suraj-subramanian/cdac-code-hub/blob/master/CppPrograms/max_of_three.cpp)
2. Find the max element in an array. [See code](https://github.com/suraj-subramanian/cdac-code-hub/blob/master/CppPrograms/max_of_array.cpp)
3. Check if given year is a leap year. [See code](https://github.com/suraj-subramanian/cdac-code-hub/blob/master/CppPrograms/leap_year.cpp)
4. Compute factorial of a number using recursion [See code](https://github.com/suraj-subramanian/cdac-code-hub/blob/master/CppPrograms/factorial_recursion.cpp)
5. Check if given string is a palindrome [See code](https://github.com/suraj-subramanian/cdac-code-hub/blob/master/CppPrograms/string_palindrome.cpp)

### Data Structures
1. Stack data structure using array. [See code](https://github.com/suraj-subramanian/cdac-code-hub/blob/master/data-structures/stack.cpp)
